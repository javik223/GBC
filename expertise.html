					<p>In the last 15 years, the Nigerian Economy has recorded significant growth and has now overtaken South Africa to become the largest economy in Africa. A lot of the growth has been spurred by the emergence and high level of activities in such new sectors as telecoms, entertainment, information technology and e-commerce. This has been accompanied by the development of new ideas and innovation. The importance of protecting these ideas and innovations cannot be over-emphasized.</p>
					<p>GBC provides legal support to its clients on all aspects of intellectual property protection and enforcement. We provide practical and commercial legal advice at every stage in the life and development of an intellectual property right, from creation and exploitation to protection and enforcement. In particular, we assist in the registration of Patents, Trademarks and Industrial designs, and processing of approvals from NOTAP for Technical Services Agreements, Licensing Agreements and other Technical Transfer Agreements.</p>
