NOTE:

1. Added Foundation via a CDN because all those floats, ðŸ‘€.
2. I couldn't use SCSS with the version of Codekit I got(3.1+) as it broke the project, so all my styles are in `main.css` in the `assets/css` directory. Thanks to Foundation, they're minimal stuff.
3. There's one page left which you'll get before you wake up Friday morning, the single publications page for individual publications.
4. Also, the carousels.

And there's a lot of magic CSS in that code. DevTools sef was confused.
