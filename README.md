# GBC Law

NOTE:

1. Added Foundation via a CDN because all those floats, ðŸ‘€.
2. I couldn't use SCSS with the version of Codekit I got(3.1+) as it kept breaking the project everytime I cloned. So all my styles are in `main.css` in the `assets/css` directory. Thanks to Foundation, they're minimal stuff. I'll look into getting rid of the entire CDN and just including the grid files in the CSS after though.
3. There's one page left which you'll get before you wake up tomorrow morning, the single publications page for individual publications.
4. Also, the carousels.

And there's a lot of magic CSS in that code. DevTools sef was confused.
