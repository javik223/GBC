<p>NOTE:</p>

<ol>
<li>Added Foundation via a CDN because all those floats, ðŸ‘€.</li>
<li>I couldn&#8217;t use SCSS with the version of Codekit I got(3.1+) as it kept breaking the project everytime I cloned. So all my styles are in <code>main.css</code> in the <code>assets/css</code> directory. Thanks to Foundation, they&#8217;re minimal stuff. I&#8217;ll look into getting rid of the entire CDN and just including the grid files in the CSS after though.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s one page left which you&#8217;ll get before you wake up tomorrow morning, the single publications page for individual publications.</li>
<li>Also, the carousels.</li>
</ol>

<p>And there&#8217;s a lot of magic CSS in that code. DevTools sef was confused.</p>
